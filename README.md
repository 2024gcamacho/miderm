# Miderm - Guadalupe Camacho CS:3980

## The purpose of the project is a to-od type of application using backend protocols covered in the lecture. I created a journaling app so that you can add in a daily log by date, and journal about activities or thoughts.

 ##Studying the professor's code, I was able to understand the nuances of using Uvicorn and FastAPI. This code uses requires installation of packages through the requirments packages and uses and Python virtual environment. The front end uses a mix of JS, HTML, and bootstrap. 
##Future development would include a sorting feature by date, and the ability to create an account to save your entry data. Hopefully an archive tab, so that if someone were to use this application for years they would be able to keep old entries but not have it clog up the home page. Also different tabs that would catagorize enttires based on what the users decide to name it. Maybe a regular "what I did today" tab and another tab for "mood journaling'
